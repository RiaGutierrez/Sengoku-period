Following the chaos of the sixteenth-century warring states period, Japanâ€™s reunification was a process that took almost half a century. It began with a Machiavellian-type leader, Oda Nobunaga. He spared no one who stood in his way, including the shogun and the Buddhist church. Perhaps it took such draconian measures to discourage the prevailing thought that loyalty to any authority was a thing of the past. Hideyoshi continued the work started by his lord but used diplomatic persuasion more than military might to bring Japan together. Hideyoshi also implemented social and land reforms that laid a foundation for Tokugawa Ieyasu to build upon. Finally, Ieyasu combined both the harsh rule of Nobunaga and the political acumen of Hideyoshi to establish the Tokugawa bakufu which led to almost three centuries of peace and economic stability throughout Japan.
