Oda Nobunaga, Toyotomi Hideyoshi, and Tokugawa Ieyasu (following the Japanese pattern of the surname coming before the given name) were all samurai from central Honshu. But that’s about where their similarities end. Their personalities and careers are contrasted by the following two anecdotes. A story is told that there was a bird that refused to sing. Nobunaga’s response was to warn the bird, “Sing or I’ll kill you.” Hideyoshi coaxed the bird by saying “I’ll teach you to sing.” Meanwhile, Ieyasu sat back and thought “I’ll wait for the bird to sing.”  Another tale explains the pattern of how these three reunified Japan from a culinary perspective: Nobunaga kneaded the dough; Hideyoshi baked the pie; and Ieyasu ate the pie. The following paragraphs flesh out the meaning of these apocryphal stories.
